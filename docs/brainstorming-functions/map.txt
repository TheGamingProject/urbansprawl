vars:
  minimapBounds
  fieldBounds  // playfield
  
  terrainGrid
  buildingGrid - array[x][y] of buildings
    - multiple spots will link to the same building

  buildingCount - array[id] 


funcs:

init({minimapBounds,fieldBounds,drawfirst})
  -inits easel containers for minimap and field
  -calls generateTerrain()
  -calls initMinimap()
  
initMinimap()
  -inits minimap based off terrain map

generateTerrain()
  -creates a container
  -generates the terrain, sets the images to the gridspots 

update()
  -? does this do anything?

getSpotWorth()
  - returns how much a spot is 'worth'
 
checkSpot({x,y,width,height,unbuildableTerrain})
  - checks if an area does not have any buildings or terrain
  - by default, unbuildableTerrain={mountain,volcanom,water,hills}
  
boolean buildHere({x,y,buildingID})
  - will return false if x,y,width,height would be off the screen
  - assumes you checked the spot, otherwise force builds
  - creates the building object and assigns it to buildingGrid
  - updates buildingCounts
  
clickMinimap()
  
moveViewport()
  -moves minimap viewport too
  
processBuildingTurns()
  - called by gameplay.doTurn
  - returns the amount of income (from tax)
  - loops thru the buildings building.processTurn({gridspot})
  
processUpkeep()
  - called by gameplay.doUpkeep
  - returns the amount of upkeep (from buildings)
  - loops thru the buildings building.processUpkeep({gridspot})
